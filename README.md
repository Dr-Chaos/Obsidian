# Obsidian
Skin changer for CS:GO.

## Warning
Obsidian comes as is with no guarantees regarding its standing with VAC. This is a cheat and will most likely get you banned if you attempt to use it on any cheat protected servers. I have only tested Obsidian on private servers with VAC disabled and recommend you do the same. I do not encourage cheating in any form.

* [Pymem](https://github.com/srounet/Pymem)
